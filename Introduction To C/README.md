## Introduction to C:

1. Write a program that takes two integers from the user and prints the results of this equation:
   Result = ((num1 + num2) * 3) - 10

2. Write a program that prints your name and your grade in a new line.

3. Write a program for converting temperature from degrees Celsius to degrees Fahrenheit, given the formula:
   F = (C x 9/5) + 32

4. Write a program that reads the radius of a circle and calculates the area and circumference, then prints the results.

5. Write a program to print the ASCII value of a character input by the user.
